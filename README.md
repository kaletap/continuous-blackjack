In a `blackjack.ipynb` notebook I implemented simple version of blackjack game to understand it's rules.

In a `continuous_blackack.ipynb` notebook there is some analysis of a mathematical version of blackjack:
each player draws a card from a continuous uniform distribution between 0 and 1. The player wins if she gets the highest value among all the other players not exceeding 1. I describe what is the optimal strategy to play this game.
